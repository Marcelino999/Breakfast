            "These pancakes are passed down fom my grandmother, who was fully Scandinavian. They are light and fluffy, and great with berry syrups. I have made these for years as a special treat, and I hope you enjoy them as much as my family has."</li>

            Ingrediants    
         </h2>

        <ul>
            <li> 1 cup flour</li>
            <li> 1 egg</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li> 1 1/8 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Directions
        </h2> 
            <ol>
              <li> Preheat and lightly grease a large skillet or electric griddle.</li>
              <li> Mix the flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Add the egg, buttermilk, and butter; stir together lightly, but keep it lumpy. The batter should look thick, spongy, and puffy.</li>
              <li> Drop 1/3 cup of the batter onto the cooking surface, spreading lightly with the bottom of the cup. Cook until lightly-browned on each side, 1 to 2 minutes per side.</li>
            </ol>
