# **Moms Buttermilk Pancakes**

#### "These pancakes are passed down from my grandmother, who was fully Scandinavian. They are light and fluffy, and great with berry syrups. I have made these for years as a special treat, and I hope you enjoy them as much as my family has." ####

## **Ingrediants** ##
* 1 cup flour
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 1/8 cups buttermilk
* 2 tablespoons butter, melted

## **Directions** ##

* Preheat and lightly grease a large skillet or electric griddle.

* Mix the flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Add the egg, buttermilk, and butter; stir together lightly, but keep it lumpy. The batter should look thick, spongy, and puffy.

* Drop 1/3 cup of the batter onto the cooking surface, spreading lightly with the bottom of the cup. Cook until lightly-browned on each side, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
